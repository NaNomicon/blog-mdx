## Content Management System Refactoring & Planning

### Overview
Refactored the blog's content management system to use a centralized library with Zod validation, implemented a drafts preview mechanism, and updated scaffolding scripts for better asset management.

### Accomplishments
- Created `lib/content.ts` with Zod schemas for `BlogPostMetadata` and `NoteMetadata`.
- Implemented `getAllPosts` and `getPostBySlug` helpers in `lib/content.ts` with support for drafts preview in development mode.
- Refactored `app/blog/page.tsx` and `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to use the new centralized content library.
- Updated `scripts/new-blog.js` to support the new `public/covers/` convention for images.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Scattered content logic**: Consolidated `fs` and `path` operations into a single library (`lib/content.ts`).
- **Metadata Type Safety**: Added Zod validation to ensure MDX exports match expected types, preventing runtime errors.
- **Draft Preview Workflow**: Integrated a preview mode that allows viewing files in `content/drafts/` without moving them.

### Next Steps
- Implement the "Snippets & Notes" UI and "Daily Digest" grouping logic.
- Add `scripts/new-note.js` for quick note scaffolding.
- Implement tag and category archiving pages.

## Snippets & Notes Feature Implementation

### Overview
Implemented the full Snippets & Notes system, enabling short-form content publishing with a "digital garden" aesthetic, masonry layout, and fluid modal navigation.

### Accomplishments
- Implemented `app/notes/page.tsx` with a responsive masonry layout using Tailwind `columns-` utilities (max 3 columns).
- Created a robust query-parameter based modal system (`?note=slug`) to ensure background persistence and reliable navigation.
- Developed `NoteCard` to render full MDX content directly in the list view using dynamic imports.
- Created `NoteDetail` and `NoteDialog` components for shared snippet viewing logic.
- Implemented `StickyHeader` for real-time filtering by `collection` and `tags` using query parameters.
- Added collection-specific archive pages at `app/notes/collection/[name]/page.tsx`.
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the dialog view and optimized the color theme to match site branding (removing orange/coral hover states).
- Generated 10 sample snippets across various categories for system verification.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **TypeScript Type Narrowing**: Resolved a narrowing issue with `searchParams` in filter callbacks by capturing values into local constants.
- **Content Mixing**: Fixed a bug where long-form blog drafts were appearing in the notes section by adding strict `collection` field validation in `lib/content.ts`.
- **Navigation Inconsistency**: Replaced "Intercepting Routes" with a query-parameter modal state to fix issues where the background list would disappear on certain navigation flows.
- **UI Distinguishability**: Enhanced card styling with better shadows, content boxing, and background contrast to clearly separate dense text blocks.

### Next Steps
- Implement infinite scroll for the notes feed as content volume grows.
- Integrate snippet creation into the Telegram bot workflow.
- Add a "Daily Digest" grouping view to consolidate notes published on the same day.

## Notes Filter Enhancement & SEO Refinement

### Overview
Improved the Notes filtering system with advanced multi-select tags, date range filtering, and server-side sorting while resolving critical Radix UI dependency conflicts.

### Accomplishments
- Refactored `components/notes/notes-filter.tsx` (formerly `StickyHeader`) with Shadcn UI `Select`, `Command`, and `Popover` components.
- Implemented multi-select tag filtering with AND logic on the server side in `app/notes/page.tsx`.
- Added a Date Range filter using `react-day-picker` and `date-fns`.
- Implemented a Sort Toggle (Newest/Oldest first) with server-side logic.
- Installed and synchronized Radix UI packages to resolve `createSlot` import errors.
- Optimized UI layout with right-aligned filters and enhanced z-index layering for dropdowns.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Radix UI Version Conflict**: Resolved an issue where `@radix-ui/react-popover` and `@radix-ui/react-slot` had incompatible versions by updating all Radix dependencies to their latest versions.
- **Interactivity and Hydration**: Fixed non-responsive inputs by wrapping `NotesFilter` in a `Suspense` boundary and using a `mounted` state check to ensure safe client-side initialization.
- **Search Input Styling**: Removed the default focus ring from `CommandInput` in `components/ui/command.tsx` for a cleaner aesthetic.
- **Layout Overlap**: Increased page padding and adjusted z-index to prevent filters from being hidden by the sticky site header.

### Next Steps
- Implement `BlogPostStructuredData` on individual note pages to improve search engine visibility.
- Add `BreadcrumbStructuredData` to the notes list and individual note views.
- Consider switching masonry cards to link to dedicated `/notes/[slug]` URLs for better crawlability while maintaining modal behavior via Intercepting Routes.
