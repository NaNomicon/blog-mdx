## Content Management System Refactoring & Planning

### Overview
Refactored the blog's content management system to use a centralized library with Zod validation, implemented a drafts preview mechanism, and updated scaffolding scripts for better asset management.

### Accomplishments
- Created `lib/content.ts` with Zod schemas for `BlogPostMetadata` and `NoteMetadata`.
- Implemented `getAllPosts` and `getPostBySlug` helpers in `lib/content.ts` with support for drafts preview in development mode.
- Refactored `app/blog/page.tsx` and `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to use the new centralized content library.
- Updated `scripts/new-blog.js` to support the new `public/covers/` convention for images.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Scattered content logic**: Consolidated `fs` and `path` operations into a single library (`lib/content.ts`).
- **Metadata Type Safety**: Added Zod validation to ensure MDX exports match expected types, preventing runtime errors.
- **Draft Preview Workflow**: Integrated a preview mode that allows viewing files in `content/drafts/` without moving them.

### Next Steps
- Implement the "Snippets & Notes" UI and "Daily Digest" grouping logic.
- Add `scripts/new-note.js` for quick note scaffolding.
- Implement tag and category archiving pages.

## Snippets & Notes Feature Implementation

### Overview
Implemented the full Snippets & Notes system, enabling short-form content publishing with a "digital garden" aesthetic, masonry layout, and fluid modal navigation.

### Accomplishments
- Implemented `app/notes/page.tsx` with a responsive masonry layout using Tailwind `columns-` utilities (max 3 columns).
- Created a robust query-parameter based modal system (`?note=slug`) to ensure background persistence and reliable navigation.
- Developed `NoteCard` to render full MDX content directly in the list view using dynamic imports.
- Created `NoteDetail` and `NoteDialog` components for shared snippet viewing logic.
- Implemented `StickyHeader` for real-time filtering by `collection` and `tags` using query parameters.
- Added collection-specific archive pages at `app/notes/collection/[name]/page.tsx`.
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the dialog view and optimized the color theme to match site branding (removing orange/coral hover states).
- Generated 10 sample snippets across various categories for system verification.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **TypeScript Type Narrowing**: Resolved a narrowing issue with `searchParams` in filter callbacks by capturing values into local constants.
- **Content Mixing**: Fixed a bug where long-form blog drafts were appearing in the notes section by adding strict `collection` field validation in `lib/content.ts`.
- **Navigation Inconsistency**: Replaced "Intercepting Routes" with a query-parameter modal state to fix issues where the background list would disappear on certain navigation flows.
- **UI Distinguishability**: Enhanced card styling with better shadows, content boxing, and background contrast to clearly separate dense text blocks.

### Next Steps
- Implement infinite scroll for the notes feed as content volume grows.
- Integrate snippet creation into the Telegram bot workflow.
- Add a "Daily Digest" grouping view to consolidate notes published on the same day.

## Content Creation: "Show Your Work" Collection

### Overview
Started a new notes collection based on the book "Show Your Work" by Austin Kleon, adding the first foundational note.

### Accomplishments
- Created `content/notes/260113-a-new-way-of-operating.mdx` with metadata for the "Show Your Work" collection.
- Split "You don't have to be a genius" into 4 granular notes:
  - `content/notes/260113-find-a-scenius.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-be-an-amateur.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-you-cant-find-your-voice-if-you-dont-use-it.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-read-obituaries.mdx`
- Added 2 notes for "Think process, not products":
  - `content/notes/260113-take-people-behind-the-scenes.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-become-a-documentarian-of-what-you-do.mdx`
- Added 4 notes for "Share something small every day":
  - `content/notes/260113-send-out-a-daily-dispatch.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-the-so-what-test.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-turn-your-flow-into-stock.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-build-a-good-domain-name.mdx`
- Added 3 notes for "Open up your cabinet of curiosities":
  - `content/notes/260113-dont-be-a-hoarder.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-no-guilty-pleasures.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-credit-is-due.mdx`
- Added 2 notes for "Tell good stories":
  - `content/notes/260113-work-doesnt-speak-for-itself.mdx`
  - `content/notes/260113-structure-is-everything.mdx`
- Verified that the new collection "Show Your Work" is automatically picked up by the `NotesFilter` and collection archive pages.

### Next Steps
- Add more notes from the "Show Your Work" collection as they are synthesized.
- Implement `scripts/new-note.js` to streamline note creation.
- Add structured data to individual note pages.

## Notes Filter Enhancement & SEO Refinement

### Overview
Improved the Notes filtering system with advanced multi-select tags, date range filtering, and server-side sorting while resolving critical Radix UI dependency conflicts.

### Accomplishments
- Refactored `components/notes/notes-filter.tsx` (formerly `StickyHeader`) with Shadcn UI `Select`, `Command`, and `Popover` components.
- Implemented multi-select tag filtering with AND logic on the server side in `app/notes/page.tsx`.
- Added a Date Range filter using `react-day-picker` and `date-fns`.
- Implemented a Sort Toggle (Newest/Oldest first) with server-side logic.
- Installed and synchronized Radix UI packages to resolve `createSlot` import errors.
- Optimized UI layout with right-aligned filters and enhanced z-index layering for dropdowns.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Radix UI Version Conflict**: Resolved an issue where `@radix-ui/react-popover` and `@radix-ui/react-slot` had incompatible versions by updating all Radix dependencies to their latest versions.
- **Interactivity and Hydration**: Fixed non-responsive inputs by wrapping `NotesFilter` in a `Suspense` boundary and using a `mounted` state check to ensure safe client-side initialization.
- **Search Input Styling**: Removed the default focus ring from `CommandInput` in `components/ui/command.tsx` for a cleaner aesthetic.
- **Layout Overlap**: Increased page padding and adjusted z-index to prevent filters from being hidden by the sticky site header.

### Next Steps
- Implement `BlogPostStructuredData` on individual note pages to improve search engine visibility.
- Add `BreadcrumbStructuredData` to the notes list and individual note views.
- Consider switching masonry cards to link to dedicated `/notes/[slug]` URLs for better crawlability while maintaining modal behavior via Intercepting Routes.

## Notes Infinite Scroll Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a seamless, silent infinite scroll experience for the Notes feed to handle increasing content volume while maintaining layout stability.

### Accomplishments
- Created `lib/notes.ts` to centralize filtering, sorting, and pagination logic for notes.
- Implemented `app/notes/actions.ts` as a Next.js Server Action to allow client-side fetching of subsequent note pages.
- Developed `InfiniteNotesStream` client component using `IntersectionObserver` with a large `rootMargin` (800px) for predictive background loading.
- Refactored `app/notes/page.tsx` to utilize server-side initial load of 10 notes followed by client-side streaming.
- Improved layout stability by replacing CSS `columns` with a manual "even/odd" distribution across a 2-column grid, preventing "jumping" as new items load.
- Added smooth entrance animations (fade + slide-up) and discreet loading indicators to `NoteCard`.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Layout Jumping**: CSS `columns` caused items to re-sort and jump across columns when new data arrived. Resolved by manually distributing items into fixed column containers (Stable Multi-Column Grid).
- **Flickering Placeholders**: Softened `animate-pulse` and adjusted colors in `NoteCard` MDX placeholders to reduce visual noise during background imports.
- **Subtle Loading**: Optimized the loading indicator to only appear if network latency causes the user to actually reach the scroll boundary, using a gentle fade-in.

### Next Steps
- Apply similar infinite scroll patterns to the main Blog feed if the post count increases.
- Optimize MDX dynamic import prefetching for even faster card rendering.
