## Content Management System Refactoring & Planning

### Overview
Refactored the blog's content management system to use a centralized library with Zod validation, implemented a drafts preview mechanism, and updated scaffolding scripts for better asset management.

### Accomplishments
- Created `lib/content.ts` with Zod schemas for `BlogPostMetadata` and `NoteMetadata`.
- Implemented `getAllPosts` and `getPostBySlug` helpers in `lib/content.ts` with support for drafts preview in development mode.
- Refactored `app/blog/page.tsx` and `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to use the new centralized content library.
- Updated `scripts/new-blog.js` to support the new `public/covers/` convention for images.

### Issues & Resolutions
- **Scattered content logic**: Consolidated `fs` and `path` operations into a single library (`lib/content.ts`).
- **Metadata Type Safety**: Added Zod validation to ensure MDX exports match expected types, preventing runtime errors.
- **Draft Preview Workflow**: Integrated a preview mode that allows viewing files in `content/drafts/` without moving them.

### Next Steps
- Implement the "Snippets & Notes" UI and "Daily Digest" grouping logic.
- Add `scripts/new-note.js` for quick note scaffolding.
- Implement tag and category archiving pages.
