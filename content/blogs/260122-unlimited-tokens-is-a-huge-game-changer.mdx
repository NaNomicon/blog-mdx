I've been a dedicated [Cursor](https://cursor.com) user for a while now, but I still find myself reaching for [Claude](https://claude.ai)'s high-end models whenever I hit a particularly gnarly architectural wall. However, I've spent the last few months looking at the new [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI through a glass wall. 

Whenever I'd think about giving it a real spin, I'd look at the potential costs and hesitate. Even within Cursor, there's that subtle "meter anxiety." Every time an assistant misinterprets a prompt or hallucinates a library, I feel that tiny sting of a wasted token—or a step closer to a usage cap.

So I'd often revert to cheaper models. But that created its own trap: I'd end up re-checking, re-implementing, and fixing the same bugs over and over again on a "bad day" when the cheap model just wasn't cutting it. It was a lose-lose.

Then I found [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

## The OpenCode Alternative

OpenCode is essentially an AI gateway that's currently offering a list of [Zen models](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/#pricing)—some of which are completely free for a limited time. We're talking models like **Grok Code Fast 1**, **GLM 4.7**, and **MiniMax M2.1**.

For an indie dev or a hobbyist, this is an absolute game-changer. It's not just about "free stuff"; it's about the psychological shift that happens when the tokens are unlimited.

## From "Cost-Anxiety" to "Stable Planning"

When I'm not worried about the cost of a request, my behavior changes:

1.  **I plan more**: Instead of rushing into code to "save tokens," I spend more time in the planning phase. I can ask the AI to brainstorm five different architectures, critique them, and refine the best one.
2.  **Stable Features**: Because I'm planning more, the resulting features are more stable. I'm not patching holes that I could have avoided if I had just thought it through for 5 minutes longer.
3.  **No More "Re-checking" Cycles**: With the "cheap vs expensive" dilemma, I was always second-guessing. Now, even if a model is slightly "dumber" than the top-tier paid ones, the fact that I can iterate on it indefinitely without a bill means I can eventually reach a higher quality result than a single "expensive" shot that might miss.

## Real-World Use Cases

### The Second Brain (Obsidian + MCP)

One of the biggest wins for me has been my **Obsidian vault**. I've always wanted to integrate more AI into my "second brain," but I always held back because of—you guessed it—the cost. 

Using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), I can now point these free models at my entire vault. The ability to have an AI that actually *knows* my notes, can link ideas together, and help me organize my thoughts without me worrying about the meter running is huge. 

The integration existed before, but the "barrier to entry" wasn't technical; it was financial. 

### Consolidating General AI Tasks

Because the tokens I use within my [Cursor](https://cursor.com) subscription aren't truly unlimited (the high-end models have usage caps), I've always maintained a separate subscription to services like [t3.chat](https://t3.chat) for "general" AI work—things like broad research, searching for documentation, or brainstorming non-coding ideas. 

With OpenCode, that's no longer necessary. I can move those general prompts and research cycles over to the free models. It's one less subscription to manage and one more area where I don't have to keep an eye on a countdown timer.

## The Catch: The Speed-Cost Trade-off

Of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch. The primary downside isn't just a simple delay in starting—it's the overall **execution speed**. 

Compared to the snappy, near-instant responses in Cursor, these free models (or the gateway itself) run noticeably slower. It's as if they're "thinking" harder, or perhaps the infrastructure just isn't as optimized. I've noticed significant latencies between individual "thoughts" and especially between consecutive **tool uses**. A complex task that would be a quick sequence in a paid model becomes a slow, deliberate crawl here.

But here's the thing: I don't really mind. 

When you remove the financial pressure of the "meter," you can afford to wait. That extra minute spent watching a model deliberate is often time I can use to refine my own next steps. I'd much rather have a slightly slower, more deliberate assistant that I can use for "weird" experiments than a lightning-fast one that makes me check my bank balance every time I hit Enter.

## The "Weird" Experiments

This freedom lets me dive into the "weird things"—projects that aren't "serious" enough to justify a $20/month subscription or a pay-per-token bill. 

For example, I've been playing around with [job-hunter-mcp](https://github.com/patrickvicente/job-hunter-mcp), a Model Context Protocol server for managing job applications. Is it a "weird experiment"? Maybe. But when the tokens are free, why not? It lowers the floor for innovation and lets me explore niches I would have otherwise ignored. 

I'm already planning to hook up a few more specialized MCPs to see where else I can push this.

## Unlimited Possibilities

Honestly, the currently free models on OpenCode are surprisingly good. But even if they were mediocre, having an assistant with "limitless possibilities" is a massive deal. 

If you haven't checked out OpenCode yet, do yourself a favor and look at their [Zen pricing](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/#pricing). It might just change how you think about AI-assisted development.
