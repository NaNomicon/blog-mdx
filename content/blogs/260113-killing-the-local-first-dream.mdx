I've been stuck in a loop for weeks.

On one hand, I'm obsessed with the idea of [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/). I want to build apps that respect the user—apps where the data and computation stay on their machine. It's "free" for me to host (the ultimate scale-to-zero), and it's a better experience for the user. No more "dead zones" in the subway, no more spinning loaders when 5G gets flaky. It feels like the "right" way to build software.

On the other hand, the complexity is killing me. Trying to build a robust sync engine or a [CRDT-based system](https://automerge.org/) as an indie dev feels like I'm doing "perfect surgery on a dead patient." I'm so worried about the architecture that I'm not actually shipping any features.

I'm finally realizing that I might be overthinking this.

## The 1-Billion-Person Reality Check

I started looking at the numbers. There are over a billion people globally who have smartphones but don't have regular, reliable internet. That's a massive market I'd be ignoring if I went cloud-only.

But I also realized that even for the person with the best 5G plan, connectivity is fragile. A "Cloud-Only" app is essentially a lease on an application's life. If the connection drops or the provider changes their tier, the app is a brick. I still want that "instant" feel. I want my app to be like [Linear](https://linear.app/method/scaling-the-linear-sync-engine) or [Notion](https://www.localfirst.fm/)—tools that don't just work offline, but feel "memory-speed" because the UI isn't waiting on a round-trip to a server.

## The "Cost of Success" Anxiety

The other thing holding me back from the cloud was the "Success Tax." As an indie dev, the thought of a surprise $500 bill from a managed service because of a spike in users is terrifying.

But I've realized that 2026 isn't 2016. The tools have changed. Services like Convex or Supabase have generous free tiers, and "scale-to-zero" is the new standard. If I don't have users, I don't have a bill. And if I do have enough users to trigger a bill, I have a "high-quality problem"—one I can actually monetize.

## My New Action Plan: The Hybrid Path

I've decided to stop trying to build a local-first masterpiece in a vacuum. Here is how I'm moving forward:

1. **Stop solving for the "Canyon Case"**: I'm not going to spend months on a sync engine for the 0.1% of time a user is in a total dead zone. If they lose 5G, it's okay if they just see a "Syncing..." toast for a minute.
2. **Velocity first with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/blog/what-is-sync)**: I'm going to use Convex to get the backend out of the way. It gives me that \"live\" reactive feel and [optimistic updates](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/optimistic-updates) out of the box. It's "pseudo-local" enough to keep the UI snappy without the architectural nightmare.
3. **The "Good Enough" Offline**: I'll use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/persist-query-client) with IndexedDB persistence. The app will load instantly and show the last-known data even if the phone is in airplane mode. That solves 90% of the frustration for 10% of the effort.
4. **Monetize for Sustainability**: I'll probably go with a "Sync-as-a-Service" model. Keep the core local experience free and charge for the convenience of cloud sync. This keeps my costs aligned with my revenue.

## The Bottom Line

I can always add a deeper local-sync layer later if the app actually gains traction. But right now, my biggest risk isn't a lack of offline support—it's a lack of users.

It's time to stop architecting and start shipping. The 5G might expire, but the project shouldn't.
