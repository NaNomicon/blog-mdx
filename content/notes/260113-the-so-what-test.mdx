***Share something small every day***

Ideally you want the things you share to also be shared and spread over the internet, so don't overshare, don't post things that you're not ready for the world to see. You're sharing things because you think that it might be helpful or entertaining to your audiences.

"Always be sure to run everything you share with others through the 'So What?' test." Make sure it's helpful, or entertaining, or it's ok if my boss, my mother sees it. If you're unsure, let it sit, save it for later to evaluate.
