## Current Stack

I use a combination of flagship models for complex reasoning and "free" models for exploration and long-running tasks.

### Flagship Models (Primary)
- **[Gemini 3 Flash](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/)**: My go-to for daily tasks because of its stability and its capability in front-end development.
- **[Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)**: Still the king for complex tasks and deep architecture reviews.

### OpenCode Models (Free Tier)
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) supports a pay-as-you-go model. Recently, 3 out of 4 free models became paid, leaving only one option:

- **[Big Pickle](https://www.crackedaiengineering.com/ai-models/opencode-big-pickle)**: The only remaining free model. Large context window, good for reading documentation.

*(Grok Code Fast 1, MiniMax M2.1, and GLM 4.7 are no longer free)*

## My Thoughts & Observations

The free models provided by OpenCode don't feel as polished as the flagship models yet, but the gap is closing.

- **Big Pickle Maturity**: Being the only free option left, I don't think it's as mature as the others. It works, but feels a step behind the ones that got paywalled.
- **Usage Strategy**: I use OpenCode's free model (Big Pickle) for "weird experiments" or tasks where I need to iterate many times without worrying about cost.
- **Speed vs. Accuracy**: **Grok Code Fast 1** is incredibly fast but often breaks the code by failing to edit files properly (missing semicolons, multiple closing brackets, etc). It feels like early Copilot—great for autocomplete, risky for reliable refactoring.
- **Coding with GLM**: I've been using **GLM 4.7** heavily recently. It's surprisingly good at understanding context, though it lacks the "creativity" or nuance that Claude brings to the table.
