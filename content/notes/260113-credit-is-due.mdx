***Open up your cabinet of curiosities***

It's always required for you to give proper credits, "... share the works of others as if it were your own, treadting it with respect and care." Failing to give proper credits you not only rob the original creator but also undermine the audiences you are sharing with, without credits, people won't be able to find more information about the work (that they might like).

Provide context for the things you are sharing: what is it, who/how/when/where/why made it, why you share it, etc. Another form people usually miss is where we found the work that we're sharing. Shout-out to whoever shared the work before you that let you know about it, and also leave a trail that your audiences can also follow for their inspiration. Include a link directly to the work, no one is gonna spend a Google search to find the original source.

Don't share things you can't credit, credit the work, or don't share it at all.
