*Knuckleballers* - the pitchers who are able to throw a ball that doesn't spin, making it difficult to hit, which is hard and probably only a handful number of pitchers can do that.

Apparently unlike other pitches, the knuckleballers like to hang out with each other, teach each other, and help each other improve.

You will meet your knuckleballers when you start to share your work, they'll be very important, so value them, treat them well, share your works with them first, do anything to keep them close.
