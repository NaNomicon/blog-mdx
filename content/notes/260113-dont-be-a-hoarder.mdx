***Open up your cabinet of curiosities***

To be honest, I don't fully understand this section, however I think this is what it means. The things you collect also define who you are, the inspirations, the things you read, watch, listen to, etc, also convey your taste. Before you're comfortable sharing your own works, sharing your collection is also an option.
