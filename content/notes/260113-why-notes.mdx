I've always been an avid reader. I consume a vast number of articles online every single day, covering everything from technical deep-dives to philosophical essays. However, I noticed a pattern: I'd read something brilliant, have a momentary spark of insight, and then... it would vanish into the digital ether.

I realized that I need a place to capture these ephemeral thoughts. Not everything needs to be a 2,000-word polished blog post. Sometimes, it's just a single sentence, a quote that resonated, or a quick reaction to an interesting article I want to share.

This "Notes" feature is my solution for **micro-blogging with intent**.

Beyond articles, I'm also challenging myself to read more deeply. Shallow reading is easy; deep comprehension is a discipline. To help with this, I've committed to writing notes about every book I finish. It forces me to synthesize what I've learned rather than just flipping pages.

Ultimately, this is about **Self Development in Public**. By sharing my learning process, my half-baked ideas, and my evolving thoughts, I'm creating an external accountability loop. It's one of the best ways I've found to keep myself disciplined and consistent in my personal growth.
