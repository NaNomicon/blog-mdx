***You don't have to be a genius***

Amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results, they don't hesitate to do the works that others will think that they're stupid, they'll use whatever tools they can get their hands on to get their ideas into the world. "... You can move from mediocre to good in increaments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something." - Clay Shirky in Cognitive Surplus.

Amateurs lean in the open, others can learn from their failures and successes. Starting by committing to learn something in front of others. Find a scenius & pay attention on what they're NOT sharing, look for empty space that you can fill, no matter how bad they can be at first. "Share what you love,, and the people who love the same things will find you."
