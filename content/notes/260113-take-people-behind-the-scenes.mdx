***Think process, not products***

In all kind of work, there is a distinction between the work, and the process in making the work. In the old age, people were limited on how they can share their process, and motive to keep their methods secret. In the mordern day, there are easier to share whatever we want to share, and people are interested in other people, what other people do. "By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products."
