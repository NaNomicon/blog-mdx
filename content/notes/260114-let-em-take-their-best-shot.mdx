***Learn to take a punch***

You've get criticisms. Here's how to take them.

**Relax and breathe.** It's not the end of the world, take a breath and accept whatever comes.

**Strengthen your neck.** Put more works out there, the more the works, the more the criticisms, and you'll realize it can't hurt you.

**Roll with the punches.** Rolling forward with the criticisms, make things that they hate. You can't control what kind of criticism you'll get, but you can control how you react to it.

**Protect your vulnerabilities.** Keep the sensitive works hidden, however,

**Keep your balance.** Your work is something you do, not who you are, so keep the people who love you for you (not your work) close.
