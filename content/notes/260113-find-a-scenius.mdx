***You don't have to be a genius***

Brian Eno refers "sceniuses" as not just geniuses creating their works along but a group of people supporting, inspiring, teaching each other behind the scene, so creativity is always a collaboration. It leaves room for non-genius, we can stop thinking about how not-smart we are but focus about how we can (now more easily) contribute and influent each other's work.
