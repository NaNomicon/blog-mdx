[Manage Project and Launch Website](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/project-management/Manage-Project-Launch-Website/details) sparked thoughts on **Vibe Coding** (Andrej Karpathy, 2025)—coding by "vibes" (intent/prompting) rather than syntax.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Natural Language First**: Describe features, let AI implement.
- **Syntax Abstraction**: Focus on behavior/prototype, not underlying code.

**My Takeaways:**
1.  **Boredom vs. Low Stress**: Waiting for AI is dull, but cognitive load shifts from "how to syntax" to "what next".
2.  **New Role**: Less "coder", more architect/reviewer. The thrill is now system assembly, not solving puzzles.
3.  **Skill Concern**: AI acts as a 24/7 senior pair programmer. The joy evolves from *typing* to *creating*.
