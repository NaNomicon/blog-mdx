I've always loved seeing behind-the-scenes works, even for things I don't necessarily follow closely. For instance, I'm not a huge fan of [*Beast Games*](https://www.beastgames.com/), but I'll happily watch hundreds of their production videos. This video of [PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/@pewdiepie) visiting [**Wit Studio**](https://www.witstudio.co.jp/) (the legends behind [*Attack on Titan*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/) and [*Spy x Family*](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G4PH0WXVJ/spy-x-family)) hit that exact spot for me.

I've always been a casual anime fan -mostly sticking to the big hits or whatever's trending- so the "anime studio" aspect wasn't even the most interesting part for me. What really stood out was the **culture of development**.

Every morning, they have a "Croquis" session, a daily warm-up where animators draw each other in 30-second intervals. They review each others' drawings right then and there. Every. Single. Morning. That level of dedication to the craft is just cool to see.

It also shows in how they treated PewDiePie. He wasn't just a visitor; they treated him like one of their own, inviting him into the creative process. They let him struggle with animation, then showed him a "completed" version to compare against, providing real feedback. It's a masterclass in how much this studio (and perhaps Japanese work culture in general) values growth and mentorship.

Also, props to Pewdiepie, even his side quests are interesting.
