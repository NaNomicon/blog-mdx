};

I spent about 10 hours today grinding on an urgent feature for a client. It pays well and it's objectively "important" work. But looking back at the end of the day, the thing that actually made me feel the most accomplished was the 30 minutes I spent cleaning my room.

It's such a weird feeling. Why does tidying up a desk feel more satisfying than shipping production code?

I've learnt it's probably because my room is **mine**. I have total control over it. When I clean, the result is immediate and visible—I can literally see the floor again. Code is great, but it's often for someone else, tucked away in a repo. 

Plus, cleaning usually has that "ugh, I'll do it later" resistance. Pushing through that mundane chore felt like a small win over my own procrastination. It's less about the "productivity" and more about the self-care—clearing the physical clutter actually cleared some mental space too.

It was a good reminder that pride doesn't always scale with the paycheck. Sometimes the smallest, most "boring" wins are the ones that actually make you feel human.
