***Share something small every day***

There's no overnight success, usually overnight successes are the results of years, if not life-long of hard works; Focus on days. Once a day, review your documentatin on your work and find a piece of your process that you can share.

If you're in early stage, share the influences and inspiration; developing stage: share the methods, or works in progress; completed stage: show the final products, residues left behind, or what you've learned; If you have lots of on-going projects, report on how they're doing. 

What you share doesn't matter, the daily dispatch can be anything you want - blog post, email, tweet, etc. Don't worry about being on every platform, pick and choose based on what you do and the people you're trying to reach, and don't be afraid of new platforms.

Stick to the question "What are you working on?" Don't worry about making them perfect, you don't know what's goiod and what sucks, let your audiences decide, watch their reaction.

Don't say that you don't have time, find the time that works for you. "You find time the same place you find spare change: in the nook and crannies." You find it in the cracks between the big stuffs - your commute, lunch breaks, etc.
