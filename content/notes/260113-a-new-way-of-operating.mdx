Despite agreeing with the famous advice from the Comedian Steve Martin, "Be so good they can't ignore you", the author has another perspective, "But it's not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable." He believes putting the works out there and making them discoverable is also easy to do alongside trying to be good.

Lots of people are actively developing their skills but instead of just privately putting in the hours, they openly share their works to other people. By sharing their ideas & knownledge, they often gain much more than just audiences, the book is the author's method to "self-promote" the easy way.
