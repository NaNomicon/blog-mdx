Just read this [fascinating article](https://mirat.dev/articles/161-satir-javascript-ile-10k-dolar-yapmak/) about how a simple Fortnite countdown timer, built with just 161 lines of JavaScript, managed to generate over $10,000 in revenue through AdSense and an eventual sale on Flippa.

Honestly, I'm a bit jealous, but mostly just grateful to see proof that it's still possible to create something valuable with such a small amount of code. In a world where we're often bogged down by complex frameworks and the massive overhead of modern platforms, it's a breath of fresh air. 

Navigating the endless "hustle" of different platforms can feel like such a chore, often before you even start building anything. Knowing that marketplaces like Flippa exist and that simple, focused tools still have a place gives me a lot of hope. It's a great reminder for freelance and indie devs that you don't always need a massive engine to get where you're going - sometimes a good idea and 161 lines of code are enough.
