***Teach what you know***

Teaching others doesn't make them instantly your competitors, knowing the techniques doesn't mean you can emulate the results right away.

Think about things you can share from your process that would inform your audience. As you learn something, teach it to others.

Teaching people you are effectively generating more interest in your work, therefore it adds more value.

Sharing your knowledge generates feedbacks which in turn helps you improve your work.
