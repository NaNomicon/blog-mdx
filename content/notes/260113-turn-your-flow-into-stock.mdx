***Share something small every day***

"Flow is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist. Stock is the durable stuff. It's the content you produce that's an interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It's what people discover via search. It's what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time" - Robin Sloan. Maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background.

The stock is best made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon the flow. After making the habit of sharing daily dispatch, you will notice themes, trends, and patterns. After detecting the patterns, you can collect the small pieces and turn them into something bigger - the stock.
