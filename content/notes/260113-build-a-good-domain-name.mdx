***Share something small every day***

You should own your own place to share your works, where you can have total control of, and no one can take it away from you. A blog is a great way to get started, if you don't know how, there are lots of web designers available to help.

The website isn't just a promotion machine, it will become you on the internet. Slowly fill it with stuffs you want to share, build a good domain name, keep it clean, and eventually it will pay off.
