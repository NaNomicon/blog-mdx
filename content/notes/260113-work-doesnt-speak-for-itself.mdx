***Tell good stories***

"My work speaks for itself", no it doesn't. People want to know things about the work that you're sharing, the story you tell your audience effect how they feel about and understand the work, which effect how they value it. "... you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one."
