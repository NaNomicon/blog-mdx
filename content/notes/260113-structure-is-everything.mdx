***Tell good stories***

Structure is important, it should be tidy, sturdy, and logical; but sometime it's hard to have a good structure. 
Fairy tale structure: "Once upon a time, there was ... Every day, ... Because of that, ... Because of that... Until finally, ..."
Author John Gardner: "A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps incluiding his own doubs), and so arrives at a win, lose or draw." This structure fit more on most of the creative works.
Usually we don't know the end of our story, the three act can help: The first act is the past (what/why/how you want); The second act is where you are at the moment; The third act is the future.

Keep your audience in mind, value their time and your time.
