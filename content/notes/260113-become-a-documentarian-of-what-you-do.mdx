***Think process, not products***

Whatever you're doing, there's something interesting that people will be interested in, if only you present it in the interesting way. Sharing the process might be the the most valuable if the results of your works aren't easy to share or showcase.

"The first step is to scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting but of media that you can share." Take documentaries of what you do, write your thoughs into a notebook, take photographs of the works at different stages, shoot videos of them. Keep track of what's going on around you, and take advantage of your tools - smartphones. 

Even if you don't share the process, you will still be able to see the work more clearly and feel like you're making progress. When you're ready to share something to the world, you have a lot of materials to choose from.
